# Satellite Image Disaster Detection

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting natural disasters such as floods and fires from satellite imagery using deep learning and computer vision techniques. The goal is to assist in rapid disaster assessment using remotely sensed data.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- PyTorch
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- NumPy

## Key Features
- Image preprocessing and normalization using OpenCV
- Deep learning–based classification of disaster vs non-disaster regions
- Modular training and inference pipeline

## Current Status
🚧 Work in progress  
Model training and image preprocessing pipeline implemented. Evaluation and optimization are ongoing.

## Roadmap
- Improve CNN architecture and training accuracy
- Add multi-class disaster classification
- Integrate model evaluation metrics
- Enhance dataset size and augmentation techniques

## Motivation
Inspired by real-world applications in disaster management and satellite-based Earth observation systems.
